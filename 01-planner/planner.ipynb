      "Summary: Each task has been allocated to team members based on their individual strengths and roles within the project. John Doe, being the Project Manager, is primarily responsible for project kickoff, stakeholder communication, and content organization, ensuring that the project remains aligned with business goals. Bob Smith has been assigned design-related tasks based on his expertise, while Jane Doe takes on the bulk of the development tasks, capitalizing on her strengths in software engineering. The QA Engineers, Alice Johnson and Tom Brown, are assigned quality assurance tasks to ensure website functionality. The allocation aims to balance workload effectively while maximizing the team's strengths, thus enhancing the chances for project success within the specified timeline.\u001b[00m\n",
